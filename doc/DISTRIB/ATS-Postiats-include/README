###### beg of [README] ######

This package contains various .h and .cats files needed for compiling
C code generated from ATS source.  It is primarily meant for cross-platform
development where it is difficult to generate on the source platform object
code needed for an application designed to be running on the target platform.
Instead, it is more convenient or even necessary to compile C code on the
target platform to generate the needed object code.
